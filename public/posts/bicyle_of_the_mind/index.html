				<p>Once Steve Jobs might have said &ldquo;the computer is the Bicycle of the mind. He referred to a study where scientists compared the energy consumption in kcal of different animals for locomotion. It turned out, he said, that the Hawk is the most efficient. The human, the crone of creation, being the least efficient. However, he said, someone tested a human on a bicycle and found the human to be off the charts more efficient than any other animal. He continues with the human being the only species that can use its abilities to create tools that greatly extend what the human is capable of. This leads to his conclusion that the computer is like a bicycle of the mind. Greatly extending what it is capable of.</p>

<p>However, technology can be as much of a disease as it can be a blessing these days.</p>
